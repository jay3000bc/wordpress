For Wordpress 3.5 and above.

If you are interested in modifying any of my works, please clone or fork specific folders. Each folder has specific instructions, if required.

The Themes folder has all my Wordpress Themes
The Widgets folder has all my Wordpress Widgets. If your theme has Widget Zones, only then you can use them.
The Plugins folder has all my Wordpress Plugins.
