#### (i) jjd-code-editor is a very simple code editor, which will convert your highlighted text into code.It uses the Wordpress plugin for tinymce and uses the activeeditor.selection to select the highlighted text. It then, simply encapsulates the text with <pre><code>. A simple css, gives it some color. That's it.

#### (ii) oxelabs code eidtor uses a beautiful tinymce plugin called "codesample". It makes use of the prism library. You can see the demo in my live site, where all codes are written using this plugin. http://www.jjdas.com/
