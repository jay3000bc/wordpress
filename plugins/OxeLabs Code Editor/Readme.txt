This plugin was initially developed to serve the purpose of writing some codes in my Blog. There are many code editor plugins readily available on the internet, but I wrote this specially to understand the usage of TinyMCE plugins.

This plugin utilizes the Prism library and codesample plugin for TinyMCE. Additionally I wrote a separate plugin, just for writing codes in a simple way. But, since Prism has many added features, so I thought of creating this plugin.
