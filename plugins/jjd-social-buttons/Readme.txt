## Demonstrates the use of options in your Wordpress Plugin.
When you are developing a wordpress plugin, sometimes it is necessary to take user inputs as options and save them into the database. Every option that you create, will also create a record in the wp-options table. So, if you have four options (variables), to store user inputs - you are also creating four records in the wp-options table. This of course makes the table large with more records and is not an efficient way. I have written the same plugin (II), where I will use arrays, which is the proper way of storing multiple options. But, this example is a starting point on, how you can use options to store user inputs.
