The About Me widget is a cool wordpress add-on in the side-bar, where you can display your photo and a small description about yourself. A link button, which will take your users to your Homepage.

Feel free to modify it to your needs or just drop me a mail for any integration help. For any newer versions, you will automatically get alerts in your Wordpress installation.
