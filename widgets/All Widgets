Here you will find all my Wordpress Widgets. Download or Fork the specific widget as it is. Put the folder in your wp-content/plugins folder.

Feel free to modify it to your needs or just drop me a mail for any integration help. For any newer versions, you will automatically get alerts in your Wordpress installation.

The “About Me with Photo & Link” is a cool wordpress add-on in the side-bar, where you can display your photo and a small description about yourself. A link button, which will take your users to your Homepage.
